# Jupyter Exploration Lab

## Overview
This lab helped me learn the basics of **GitHub** and **Jupyter Notebooks**.  
I created a GitHub repository, made my first commit, and practiced working with a notebook.

## Part 1: GitHub
- Signed in to my GitHub account.  
- Explored the dashboard (repositories, issues, pull requests).  
- Created a repository called **jupyter-exploration**.  
- Edited the README file and made my first commit.  

---

## Part 2: Jupyter Notebook
- Used Google Colab (or another environment) to create a new notebook.  
- Added a **Markdown cell** with text.  
- Added a **Code cell** with `print("Hello, World!")`.  
- Ran the cells to see the output.  
- Saved the notebook as `L0_Dylan_Legault_ITAI1378.ipynb`.  
- Uploaded the notebook to GitHub using GitHub Desktop.
